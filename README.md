- I have developed a site based on disney dolls toy store and for this I have created some components named Home, Banner, Gallery, single toy etc.
- In the home page I have set Navigation bar, Banner, Gallery, Category Tab, Client Feedback, Services section and footer.
- I have designed Login and registration Page and authenticate those page in Firebase. And I have added Google sign and github sign authentication. 
- In sort by category section I have used React Tab to show toys for specific sub category data.
- Add a toy section contains a forms from where we take all the data and send those data in mongodb database. 
- From mongodb database I have retrieved data and show all the data in all toys section. Here I have added view details button which takes a new page and shows all the data and description for specific toy. 
- In My toys section one user can see the added toys for that specific user. Here I have added Edit and delete button and complete function and queries in both server side and client side for updating and deleting toy data. Update button takes a new page and show a form for updating data. After updating data it updates in my toys page also. 
- In Blog page I have added accordion to show the answers of the provided questions.
